A Mess O'Trouble code filesBy RayDunakin@aol.com11/28/95The text files in this folder contain scene code from some of the scenes in my advanced WB game, A Mess O'Trouble. Each segment of code is explained in the text. The   specific scenes I've used here are "Mineshaft," "Secretary" and "Seep." If you are interested in creating complex, advanced games with World Builder, I strongly suggest that you download A Mess O'Trouble. Play it, then study the scene and global code. For your convenience I've also included a list of all the user variables in the game, with a brief note of how they were used.The code in these files came from version 1.4 of the game. Since then, some changes have been made to later versions.
